# Heat Pump Lead Generation Business Plan

## Executive Summary

### Business Opportunity

### How to Approach Installers

**Email Template 1 (Cold Outreach):**
```
Subject: Exclusive Heat Pump Leads in [City] - £100/lead

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're an MCS-certified heat pump installer in [city]. 

I run a lead generation website focused on the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, and I'm currently generating 20-30 qualified leads per month in your area.

These are homeowners who:
✓ Are eligible for the £7,500 BUS grant
✓ Have completed our qualification quiz
✓ Are ready to discuss installation
✓ Are exclusive to you (never sold to competitors)

I charge £100 per lead, and I guarantee every lead meets BUS eligibility criteria or you get a replacement.

Would you be interested in a trial of 5 leads this month?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Website]

Just following up on my previous email about heat pump leads.

I understand you're probably busy with current projects, so I'll keep this brief.

Would it be valuable to you if I could deliver 2-3 qualified heat pump leads per week in [city]? 

If so, I'd like to offer you 5 trial leads at 50% off (£50 each instead of £100) so you can see the quality before committing.

Let me know, and I can send you the first lead as early as tomorrow.

Best,
[Your Name]
```
